Abstract
Objectives To investigate the value of multi-model based on preoperative CT scans in predicting EGFR/TP53
co-mutation status.
Methods We retrospectively included 2171 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pre-treatment
computed tomography (CT) scans and predicting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene sequencing from
West China Hospital between January 2013 and April 2024. The deep-learning model was built for predicting EGFR
/ tumor protein 53 (TP53) co-occurrence status. The model performance was evaluated by area under the curve
(AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis. We further compared multi-dimension model with three one-dimension models
separately, and we explored the value of combining clinical factors with machine-learning factors. Additionally, we
investigated 546 patients with 56-panel next-generation sequencing and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to
explore the biological mechanisms of radiomics.
Results In our cohort of 2171 patients (1,153 males, 1,018 females; median age 60 years), single-dimensional models
were developed using data from 1,055 eligible patients. The multi-dimensional model utilizing a Random Forest
classifier achieved superior performance, yielding the highest AUC of 0.843 for predicting EGFR/TP53 co-mutations in
the test set.
Conclusion The multi-dimensional model demonstrates promising potential for non-invasive prediction of EGFR
and TP53 co-mutations, facilitating early and informed clinical decision-making in NSCLC patients at risk of treatment
resistance.
