Abstract
Purpose of Review This report summarizes key insights from the 8th Annual International Symposium on Myeloprolif-
erative Neoplasms (MPN Asia 2025). The symposium brought together global experts to discuss advancements in MPN
biology, diagnostics, and therapeutics, with a focus on emerging molecular understanding, novel treatment strategies and
real-world data.
Recent Findings Molecular profiling has become essential in MPN risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making. High-
risk mutations (e.g., ASXL1, TP53) and inflammatory pathways (e.g., IL-17, NF-kB) were shown to correlate with dis-
ease progression and transformation. Interferon-based therapy is increasingly used in younger, low-risk, or treatment-naïve
patients, and is also being investigated in myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b, a novel
interferon-based therapy, demonstrated durable clinical efficacy in polycythemia vera. Its high initial-dose and accelerated
titration (HIDAT) regimen led to fast achievement of complete hematologic response, rapid reductions in JAK2V617F
allele burden, and high complete molecular response rate. Combination regimens involving ruxolitinib and agents such as
pelabresib, selinexor, and interferon showed potential for enhanced efficacy. Population-based studies from Asia contributed
regional epidemiological and treatment data, reinforcing the role of real-world evidence. Modern prognostic models such as
MIPSS70+ v2.0 and GIPSS were discussed for more precise risk prediction. Preliminary findings also suggest ropeginter-
feron alfa-2b may be a safe option during pregnancy.
Summary MPN Asia 2025 highlighted the growing role of molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics in the manage-
ment of MPNs. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b has emerged as a therapeutic potential across the MPN spectrum. Its early use and
personalized strategies are increasingly recognized. Real-world data and regional insights are shaping a more nuanced, glob-
ally informed approach to MPN care.
