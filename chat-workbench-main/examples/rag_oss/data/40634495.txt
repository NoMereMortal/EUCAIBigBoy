Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. One key reason is the lack of durable therapies
that target KRAS-dependent disease, which represents approximately 40% of CRC cases. Here, we use liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses on Drosophila CRC tumour models to identify multiple metabolites in the glucuronidation pathway
-a toxin clearance pathway that impacts most drugs-as upregulated in trametinib-resistant RAS/APC/P53 ("RAP") tumours
compared to trametinib-sensitive single mutant tumours. Genetic inhibition of different steps along the glucuronidation
pathway strongly reversed RAP resistance to trametinib; conversely, elevating glucuronidation pathway activity was sufficient to
direct trametinib resistance in RasG¹²V animals. Mechanistically, pairing oncogenic RAS with hyperactive WNT activity strongly
elevated PI3K/AKT/GLUT signalling, which in turn directed elevated glucose uptake and glucuronidation; our data also implicate the
pentose phosphate pathway in this process. We provide evidence that this mechanism of trametinib resistance is conserved in a
KRAS/APC/TP53 mouse CRC tumour organoid model. Finally, we identify two clinically accessible approaches to inhibiting drug
glucuronidation: (i) blocking an initial HDAC1-mediated deacetylation step of trametinib with the FDA-approved drug vorinostat; (ii)
reducing blood glucose by the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose. Overall, our observations demonstrate a key mechanism by
which oncogenic RAS/WNT activity promotes increased drug clearance in CRC and provides a practical path towards abrogating
drug resistance in CRC tumours.

MEK inhibitor with the demonstrated preclinical ability to block RAS pathway signalling and oncogenic transformation. Pairing activated RAS
and WNT activities leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signalling, AS160, and GLUT1/4 to increase glucose flux into cells. The result is elevated
glucuronidation and elimination of trametinib. Potential therapeutic targets include HDAC1: deacetylation is an obligatory pre-step required
for glucuronidation of some drugs including trametinib. This reaction can be reversed by P300.
