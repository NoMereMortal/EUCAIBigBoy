concentrations. Both N87R and N87p cells were infected with HV-HP and LV-HP
strains and then treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), TRAS or a
combination of both. The infection was confirmed by confocal microscopy
and downstream effects of gene expression were evaluated, focusing on Wnt-
ß-catenin signaling genes linked to metastasis and survival in HER2+ GC. HER2,
PD-L1 and PD-L2 protein levels were assessed in all cell lines using multicolor
flow cytometry (FACS) before and after HV-HP exposure.
Results: Our data revealed that HV-HP infection reduced MSH6 mRNA
expression, which is indicative of impaired DNA repair, and up-regulated
PDCD1LG2, suggesting enhanced immunosuppression. FACS analysis showed
that HV-HP modulated PD-L2 expression in HER2-amplified N87 cells and to a
lesser extent in SNU-16 and SNU-1 cells, while EGF administration increased PD-

L1 expression. A strong correlation was observed between ERBB2 expression and
TP53, but it was independent of HV-HP. A reduction of CDH1/SNAI ratio was
associated with TRAS-resistance in N87 cells.
Discussion: These results suggest that virulent H. pylori in cell lines may
contribute to altering tumor phenotype by downregulating the DNA repair
machinery, and favouring immune evasion by inducing the expression of
immunosuppressive signals, such as PDCD1LG2. Moreover, we found that
HER2-targeted therapy may contribute to modulation of CD1/immune
pathway. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these effects are
common in HER2+ GC in vivo and whether the coexistence of H. pylori infection
and TRAS treatment may influence response to immunotherapy.

(A) Summary of gene expression changes in N87 gastric cancer cells infected with H. pylori. While ERBB2 levels remain stable upon Helicobacter
pylori infection in N87p gastric cancer cells., PDCD1LG2 and CD274 is upregulated and MSH6 downregulated, highlighting infection may drive
modulation of immune and genomic stability pathways. The increase of PDCD1LG2 is significant in most treated cells, except in N87p-EGF and
trastuzumab-resistant N87R cells, where the increase did not reach a statistical significance. H. pylori infection reduces MSH6 mRNA levels in N87p
gastric cancer cells, as well as in TRAS-resistant cells (N87R and N87R-EGF), suggesting impairment of DNA repair or stress-response pathways.
