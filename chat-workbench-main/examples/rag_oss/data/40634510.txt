Acute myeloid leukemia with mutations in TP53 (TP53ᵐut AML) is fatal with a median survival of 6 months. RNA sequencing on
purified AML patient samples showed that TP53ᵐut AML had higher expression of mevalonate pathway genes. Using novel, isogenic
TP53ᵐut AML cell lines and primary samples, we determined that TP53ᵐut AML resistance to AML chemotherapy cytarabine (AraC)
correlated with increased mevalonate pathway activity, a lower induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a mitochondrial
response with increased mitochondrial mass and oxidative phosphorylation. Pretreatment with the statin class of mevalonate
pathway inhibitors reversed these effects and chemosensitized TP53ᵐut AML. The geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) branch of
the mevalonate pathway was required for TP53ᵐut AML chemoresistance. In addition to its role in mitochondria biogenesis, we
identified a novel function of GGPP in regulating glutathione for management of AraC-induced ROS. However, statins alone were
inadequate to fully reverse chemoresistance in vivo and in a retrospective study of 364 TP53ᵐut AML patients who received
chemotherapy concurrently with a statin. Finally, we identified clinical settings and strategies to successfully target the mevalonate
pathway, particularly to address the unmet need of TP53ᵐut AML.
