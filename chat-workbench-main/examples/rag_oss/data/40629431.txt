Abstract
Background Managing Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) remains challenging due to the lack of reliable biomark-
ers to predict radiotherapy (RT) response, leading to both overtreatment of indolent disease and undertreatment
of aggressive cases.
Results Through whole-exome sequencing of 147 DCIS cases, we characterized the genomic landscape of pure
DCIS and identified genetic alterations associated with the risk of recurrence, either in-situ or invasive. DCIS lesions
harbored frequent mutations in established cancer drivers (PIK3CA, TP53) and genes regulating tissue architecture,
which likely enhanced pre-invasive cell fitness but lacked prognostic value. A subset of younger patients exhibited
distinct mutational processes characterized by high mutational burden, though these were not linked to recurrence
risk. Across the cohort, five mostly mutually exclusive genes (SH2B2, PDZD8, MYO7A, MUCL3, DNASE2B), involved in cell
adhesion, membrane organization, and DNA degradation, were significantly associated with 10-year risk of local
recurrence. In RT-treated patients, we identified 27 additional mutated genes uniquely associated with recurrence,
along with SH2B2 and MUCL3. Most of these genes were involved in cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, and cell-
environment interactions. Mutations in metabolic regulators (MGAM2 and AADACL3) and REV1, which mediates DNA
damage tolerance, may impair cellular responses to RT-induced stress. Notably, we identified distinct genes prog-
nostic for in-situ versus invasive recurrence: nineteen genes predominantly involved in tissue structural maintenance
in in-situ relapse, and thirteen genes primarily affecting cell-cycle and genome-stability pathways in invasive pro-
gression. Copy number analyses revealed that pure DCIS exhibits molecular subtype-specific patterns characteristic
of invasive disease, with novel alterations associated with recurrence, including three non-adjacent gains and five
losses in regions harboring oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and genes regulating structural integrity, cell-cell
adhesion and interactions.
Conclusions While TP53, PIK3CA, and recurrent copy number alterations represent early events in tumorigenesis, they
lack prognostic value in pure DCIS, underscoring the need for alternative biomarkers. Our findings identify key genetic
alterations associated with local recurrence and RT resistance. We further uncovered distinct molecular programs
underlying in-situ versus invasive recurrence, with mutations affecting tissue structural maintenance in in-situ relapse
and cell-cycle/genome-stability pathways in invasive progression.
