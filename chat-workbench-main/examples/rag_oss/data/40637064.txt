Abstract
Background: Advanced prostate cancer is a biologically heterogeneous disease often marked by multiple genetic and
epigenetic alterations that influence tumor progression, treatment resistance, and prognosis. Among the most
frequently altered genes are PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, TMPRSS2-ERG, and ERBB2, each with potential relevance for
stratifying risk and guiding targeted therapy.
Methods: This retrospective study included 43 patients with advanced prostate cancer who underwent radical
prostatectomy. Tumor specimens were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess the
mutational status of the five markers. Clinicopathological parameters, including PSA levels, Gleason score, tumor
stage, and invasion status, were correlated with molecular alterations using multinomial logistic regression.
Results: The most common isolated alteration was PTEN loss (20.9%), followed by TP53 amplification (16.3%),
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (13.9%), AR-V7 expression (11.6%), and ERBB2 amplification (7%). Combined alterations
were also observed, with dual or triple marker expression in select aggressive cases. PTEN- and AR-V7+ were
associated with low PSA values despite aggressive pathology, while ERBB2+ correlated with high PSA levels and
high Gleason scores. TP53+ and ERBB2+ were also significantly associated with high-grade tumors (Gleason >7).
AR-V7+ was the only marker significantly associated with seminal vesicle invasion. Younger age was weakly
correlated with AR-V7+ and TP53+ status.
Conclusions: The molecular profile defined by PTEN, AR-V7, TP53, and ERBB2 identifies distinct biological subtypes
in advanced prostate cancer, each with specific prognostic and therapeutic implications. Integration of these bio-
markers into routine clinical assessment may improve treatment personalization and risk stratification. Validation
in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted.
