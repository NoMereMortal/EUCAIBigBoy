Here, we engineered hypoxia-responsive nanoparticles (NI-HA-BMs-DOX) comprising 2-nitroimidazole
(NI), hyaluronic acid (HA), bacterial magnetosomes (BMs), and doxorubicin (DOX) for targeted
drug delivery. Under tumor hypoxia, the hypoxia-sensitive NI moiety undergoes reduction to
2-aminoimidazole, inducing a transition of the nanoparticles from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic state,
thereby facilitating controlled DOX release. Cellular assays demonstrated selective DOX delivery to
HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells under hypoxic conditions, while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity
toward normal hepatocytes (HL-7702). NI-HA-BMs-DOX significantly enhanced tumor cytotoxicity and
apoptosis by upregulating caspase-3, caspase-8, and Tp53, demonstrating superior efficacy compared
to free DOX and HA-BMs-DOX. In vivo studies further confirmed the therapeutic potential of NI-HA-
BMs-DOX (4 mg/kg DOX equivalent), achieving a tumor inhibition rate of 55.38%, which exceeded
that of HA-BMs-DOX (43.88%) and free DOX (34.90%). These findings validate NI-HA-BMs-DOX as
a promising hypoxia-targeted therapeutic platform for HCC and highlight the potential of bacterial
magnetosomes in improving drug delivery strategies for cancer treatment.

Hypoxia, a pathological condition characterized by insufficient oxygen supply, plays a crucial role in the
progression of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, ischemia-related conditions,
and rheumatoid arthritis¹ Tumor hypoxia results from disrupted vascular flow or fast tumor development
exceeding oxygen delivery. Due to aberrant, inefficient blood arteries, tumor tissues have lower oxygen levels (5
mmHg) than healthy tissues (40-60 mmHg). These abnormal circulatory systems promote acute and persistent
tumor hypoxia³. A key strategy in hypoxia-targeted therapy involves the use of nitroimidazoles, which exhibit
selective hypoxia sensitivity⁴. Due to its hydrophobicity and hypoxia sensitivity, nitroimidazole has been
frequently exploited in drug carrier development in recent years The ability of nitroimidazoles to mimic the
role of oxygen in radiochemical processes has led to their widespread use as radiosensitizers for hypoxic cells⁸.
The biggest obstacles in using nitroimidazole as a radiosensitizer in hypoxic cells are boosting medication
concentration at the tumor location and avoiding deleterious side effects on normal tissues. Due to its great
sensitivity to hypoxia, 2-nitroimidazole has been frequently used in contrast and bioreductive agent research 10,11
Upon entering hypoxic cells, 2-nitroimidazole undergoes a series of enzymatic reduction reactions catalyzed
by nitroreductases, converting it into hydrophilic 2-aminoimidazoles that accumulate within hypoxic cells¹²,
which can be converted to hydrophilic 2-aminoimidazoles and retained in the cell¹³. Reoxidizing the reduced
nitro group to the original material in normoxic cells allows it to diffuse beyond the cell. The reduced nitro
group cannot be reoxidized in hypoxic cells, therefore the reduced product is further reduced and maintained.
2-nitroimidazole is potential for tumor hypoxia imaging and hypoxia-responsive drug carriers because to this
property.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used anthracycline antibiotic known for its potent anticancer effects. It
was initially isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and has been extensively utilized for treating hematological
malignancies, solid tumors, and sarcomas¹⁴,¹⁵. DOX exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through two
mechanisms: (1) intercalation into DNA, which inhibits replication and transcription 16 and (2) generation
of free radicals, leading to oxidative damage to cellular components. In addition, DOX can also inhibit the

activity of topoisomerase II, which markedly suppresses DNA replication, transcription and repair¹⁷,¹⁸. DOX is
considered one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents.
Bacterial magnetosomes (BMs) are synthesized in magnetotactic bacteria and consist of nanoscale magnetic
particles coated with lipid bilayers¹⁹, the main component of which is Fe₃O₄ or Fe₃S₄; these molecules are
arranged in a chain-like form in the cell²⁰,²¹. BMs are produced through precise genetic control and exhibit
uniformity in shape, size, and dispersity. The size of magnetosome crystals typically ranges from 35 to 120 nm
and exhibits a stable single magnetic domain characteristic²²,²³. Compared with chemically synthesized
magnetic nanoparticles²⁴, the nanometer scale of BMs enhances heating efficiency. Another advantage of BMs is
the high purity of their crystalline components; X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the crystallinity of BMs
exceeds that of chemically synthesized magnetosomes²⁵. Magnetosomes are encased in lipid bilayers that exhibit
a high density of amino and carboxyl groups on their surface, facilitating the straightforward functionalization
of biomolecules²⁶. Additionally, the presence of a magnetosome membrane and the negative charge on the
surface of the membrane endow the magnetosome with good dispersion, therefore, magnetosomes have special
advantages as drug carriers²⁷.
In this study, we developed a novel hypoxia-responsive nanoplatform, Ni-HA-BMs-DOX, which integrates
nitroimidazole (NI), hyaluronic acid (HA), bacterial magnetosomes (BMs), and doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve
selective drug release in hypoxic tumor environments. The physicochemical properties of these nanoparticles
were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-
IR). Our findings demonstrate that Ni-HA-BMs-DOX nanoparticles significantly enhance DOX accumulation
in hypoxic cancer cells, induce higher levels of apoptosis, and exhibit superior tumor inhibition compared to
free DOX or HA-BMs-DOX. By leveraging hypoxia-responsive drug release and magnetic targeting, this study
provides a promising platform for improving the therapeutic efficacy of HCC treatment.
Materials and methods
Experimental cell lines and mouse models
The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 and the human normal hepatic cell line HL-7702 were cultivated in
our laboratory. Male BALB/c nude mice (aged 6-8 weeks) were procured from Beijing Vital River Laboratory
Animal Technology (Beijing, China).
Synthesis of the NI-HA-BMs-DOX complexes
At Huaqiao University in Fujian, China, 2-nitroimidazole (NI), hyaluronic acid (HA), bacterial magnetosomes
(BMs), and doxorubicin (DOX) were synthesized. The synthesis produced NI-BOC and NI-NH, from
2-nitroimidazole: A specified amount of NI (0.5mmol), tert-butyl (6-hexyl bromide) carbamate (0.5mmol),
and potassium carbonate (0.6mmol) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) and heated at 80 °C for 1 h.
Following completion of the reaction, the mixture was naturally cooled to room temperature. The reaction
solution was extracted 2-3 times using ethyl acetate and subsequently concentrated via rotary evaporation at
40 °C. The resulting solution was purified using silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate,
3:1 v/v), yielding the purified product NI-BOC. The purified NI-BOC was dissolved in 1.2 mol/L hydrochloric
acid/methanol solution under ice bath conditions, The organic solvent was removed by rotary evaporation,
and the product was washed 2-3 times with dichloromethane to obtain NI-NH₂ (2-nitroimidazolylamine).
NI-NH, was dissolved in DMF, and 1 mg/mL bacterial magnetosomes, sodium hyaluronate (HA, 1 mg/mL),
and genipin (GP, 1.2%) were added. Cross-linking was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h at 60 rpm, resulting in the
formation of NI-HA-BMs. NI-HA-BMs were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by the
addition of the cross-linking agents N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)
and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Subsequently, 1 mL of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX, 1 mg/mL) was
introduced. The solution was sonicated at 100 W for 5 min (5s pulse on/1s pulse off). NI-HA-BMs-DOX was
obtained by stirring at 37 °C for 24 h at 60 rpm. After freeze-drying, the final product was stored at 4 °C for
further analysis.
Characterization of related complex-related properties
CDCl₂ MeOD, D,O was used to solubilize and structurally analyze NI-BOC, NI-NH, and NI-HA-BMs at 500
MHz H-NMR. The KBr tablet method was used to characterize freeze-dried HA, BMs, DOX, NI-NH₂, and
NI-HA-BMs-DOX by FT-IR. A specified amount of the material to be studied was combined, reduced to a fine
powder, pressed into a tablet, and the various functional groups were recognized within the wavenumber range
of 4000-400 cm⁻¹ after finely grinding KBr in an agate mortar.
Drug loading capacity
To make a specific concentration solution, lyophilized NI-HA-BMs-DOX was measured and reconstituted in
PBS (pH=7.4). The highest DOX absorbance wavelength was measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The
absorbance value was compared to the DOX standard curve in PBS at pH 7.4 to determine DOX content. The
DOX concentration in NI-HA-BMs-DOX was calculated using the formula: Drug loading = (W1÷W2) 100%,
where W1 represents drug content within NPs and W2 represents total NP concentration.
Cell culture
The cell lines HepG2 and HL-7702 were cultured and sustained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were kept in a humidified
environment with 5% CO2 and 95% air for an incubation period of 37 °C.

Observation and detection of cells
We used CLSM and flow cytometry to analyze HepG2 and HL-7702 cells. After fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilizing with 0.5% Triton X-100, and mark detection with FITC-MAb1, cells were nuclear counterstained
with DAPI. In flow cytometry, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, treated with FITC-MAb1, and evaluated after
removing unbound antibody. Hypoxyprobeᵀ was used to identify hypoxic areas in cells after 12 h of exposure
to 1% O₂. After treatment, cells were collected, fixed, and assessed for intracellular hypoxia using CLSM and
flow cytometry.
Cell viability was measured by MTT assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1x 10⁴ per well and cultivated to 80-90% confluence at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
Patients were treated with DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, or NI-HA-BMs-DOX (0-10 µg/mL) for 12 h under normoxic
and hypoxic (1% O₂) settings. Add 100 µL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT solution and incubate plates for 4 hours after
treatment. After adding 110 µL of DMSO to dissolve formazan crystals, cell viability was assessed by measuring
absorbance at 492 nm with a microplate reader.
Analysis of the cellular uptake of NI-HA-BMs-DOX
Cells were sown at 5x 10⁴ cells/well in 24-well plates with sterile slides and grown at 37 °C in a humid incubator
with 5% CO2. After confluence, cells were hypoxic (1% O₂) for 12 h. After adding Hypoxyprobe™-1 (6 µg/mL)
to the medium, DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, or NI-HA-BMs-DOX were added and the final DOX concentration was
10 µg/mL. Control groups received similar BMs and were incubated for 6 h under normoxic and hypoxic (1%
O₂) conditions. After incubation, cells were fixed and studied using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy to
assess experimental results.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis assay
Hoechst 33,342 stained cells for apoptosis. Cells were seeded at 5x 10⁴ cells/well in 24-well plates with sterile
slides and grown at 37 °C in a humid incubator with 5% CO2. After 80-90% confluence, the culture medium was
replaced with fresh medium containing 1 µg/mL DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX. Control groups
received an equivalent BM concentration and were incubated for 24 h under normoxic and hypoxic (1%O₂)
settings. After treatment, cells were fixed and fluorescence microscopy was used to assess apoptosis.
Apoptosis assay
HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were seeded at 5x 10⁴ cells/well in sterile coverslip-lined 24-well plates and grown
under normal conditions. Cells were treated with 1 µg/mL free DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, or NI-HA-BMs-DOX
for 12-24 h. Control groups received similar BMs and were incubated for 24 h under normoxic and hypoxic
(1% O₂) conditions. Post-treatment, cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33,342 (100 µg/mL; Solarbio,
China) at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark. Apoptotic bodies were detected and seen using fluorescence microscopy
(AopTome, Germany).
Quantitative real-time PCR
HepG2 and HL-7702 cells were seeded at 1x 10⁵ cells/well in 12-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h,
and treated with 1 µg/mL of free DOX, NI-BMs-DOX, or NI-HA-BMs-DOX for 12, 24, or 48 h. Following the
manufacturer's instructions, the Total RNA Purification Kit (Genemark, Taiwan) extracted total RNA. Using
Fast SYBR Mixture (with High ROX) (CWBIO, Beijing, China), all samples were evaluated in triplicate for
repeatability and accuracy in quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
NI-HA-BMs-DOX tumor suppression experiments in vivo
HepG2 cells X 10⁷ cells/mouse in 0.1 mL PBS) were subcutaneously implanted into the right flank of male
BALB/c nude mice to initiate tumor formation. The tumor volume was determined using the formula A X B2/2,
where A is the length and B is the width in millimeters. When the average tumor volume exceeded 40 mm³,
mice were separated into five groups (n=6) and given intravenous injections of 4 mg/kg DOX as BMs, HA-BMs-
DOX, NI-HA-BMs-DOX, or free DOX every 3 days. A control group received PBS. Every 3 days, weight and
tumor volume were measured.
Detection of iron ions in tumors
For each sample, 20 mg of tumor tissue was placed in Eppendorf tubes and 100 µL of pure nitric acid was added.
After complete digestion, the tubes were incubated at 100 °C for 3 h to decompose organic material. To eliminate
particle matter, 100 µL of the digested sample was diluted in 5 mL of ultrapure water and passed through 0.22 µm
microporous membranes. To measure iron concentration in processed samples, the iCAP 6300 equipment
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).
Mice
The protocols for animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of China
Agricultural University. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the
Institutional Ethical Committee.
Histological analysis
Tumors, heart, liver and lung tissues were selected randomly from each group (n=6) for histological analysis.
Segments of tissues were fixed in 10%formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 20 µm sections, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Stained sections were examined with a microscope.

Results
NI-HA-BMs -DOX complexes were synthesized
NI-BOC was synthesized by reacting 2-nitroimidazole with tert-butyl (6-hexyl bromide) carbamate in the
presence of potassium carbonate, followed by purification through washing with dichloromethane (2-3 times) to
yield 2-nitroimidazole hexylamine (NI-NH₂). The chemical structures of NI-BOC and NI-NH₂ were confirmed
using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1A-B). The synthesized 2-nitroimidazolylamine
was dissolved in DMF, and a mixture containing 1 mg/mL magnetosome and 1 mg/mL sodium hyaluronate
(HA) was added. Crosslinking and subsequent purification were performed to obtain NI-HA-BMs. The
structure of NI-HA-BMs was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). The
resulting NI-HA-BMs were further dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and crosslinking agents, N-

located at 3428, 1540, 1362 and 885 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1540 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the asymmetric stretching
vibration of -NO₂, the peak at 1362 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of -NO₂, the peak
at 885 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the absorption of C-N, and the peak at 3428 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the primary
amino group on the carbon chain. (D) FT-IR spectra of NI-HA-BMs, DOX and NI-HA-BMs-DOX. The NI-
HA-BMs showed a similar peak to that of the HA-BMs except for the Fe-O absorption peak at 546 cm⁻¹, and
the characteristic absorption peaks of nitroimidazole at 1540, 1360 and 860 cm⁻¹ appeared. The characteristic
absorption peaks of amide bonds were found at 2925, 1724, 1630 and 1281 cm⁻¹. The changes in the spectra
of the NI-HA-BMs-DOX compared with those of the DOX are as follows: the absorption peaks of Fe-O
(525 cm⁻¹) and 2-nitroimidazole (1560, 1364, and 861 cm⁻¹) and the characteristic peaks of amide bonds
(2927, 1630, 1560, and 1283 cm⁻¹) were observed. In addition, the primary amino peak at 2927 cm⁻¹ and the
carbonyl group peak at 1701 cm⁻¹ were attributed to the NI-HA-BMs-DOX. The peak of NI-HA-BMs-DOX
was weakened compared with that of DOX, indicating that after drug loading, the amino and carboxyl groups
of DOX were involved in the chemical reaction, resulting in the attenuation of the corresponding peak.

(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), were
added. Adriamycin hydrochloride (DOX, 1 mg/mL) was introduced, and ultrasonic crosslinking was carried
out to produce NI-HA-BMs-DOX. The final product was structurally characterized to confirm its successful
synthesis and composition (Fig. 1D).
Characterization of related properties of NI-HA-BMs-DOX after treatment with different
oxygen concentrations
Hypoxia treatment increased NI-HA-BMs-DOX particle size and lowered absolute zeta potential. Additionally,
full-wavelength UV absorption scans showed a change from 330 to 270 nm. Morphological observations showed
particle size growth and membrane breakdown (Fig. 2).
Hypoxia resulted in efficient DOX release from the NI-HA-BMs-DOX complexes
In the hypoxic tumor environment, the hypoxia-responsive group 2-nitroimidazole in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX
polymer changes from 2-nitroimidazole to 2-aminomidazole, altering its hydrophobicity and releasing the
drug from the compact nanoparticle structure, increasing drug concentration at the target site. Flow cytometry
analysis (Fig. 3A) shows that HepG2 cells release DOX from the NI-HA-BMs-DOX complex intracellularly
under hypoxia. Normal liver cells HL-7702 (Fig. 3B) have lower fluorescence than HepG2 cells under the same
circumstances, indicating a less hypoxic environment.
HepG2 cell uptake of NI-HA-BMs-DOX was examined under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using
laser confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, cells absorb free DOX better than HA-BMs-DOX
and NI-HA-BMs-DOX in normoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, DOX-treated cells had enhanced
fluorescence intensity, whereas HA-BMs-DOX cells did not. NI-HA-BMs-DOX cells did. These results support
flow cytometry findings that NI-HA-BMs-DOX releases DOX under hypoxia.

Fig. 2. Particle Size Change (A): Due to hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces, NI-HA-BMs-
DOX nanoparticles are larger than BMs. Under low oxygen, 2-nitroimidazole converts to hydrophilic
2-aminomidazole, expanding polymers and increasing particle size. (B) The zeta potential of NI-HA-BMs-
DOX falls due to surface polymer grafting, which increases particle size and reduces steric repulsion. The
reduction of 2-nitroimidazole decreases the zeta potential under low oxygen by increasing the number of
positively charged amino groups on the particle surface. (C) UV Absorption Wavelength modifications: NI-
HA-BMs-DOX maximizes UV absorption at 330 nm, which shifts to 270 nm under low oxygen circumstances,
suggesting the chemical transformation from 2-nitroimidazole to 2-aminoimidazole and nanoparticle
molecular structural modifications. (D) Morphological Changes: Transmission electron microscopy shows that
NI-HA-BMs-DOX makes a structured membrane around magnetic particles with a thicker outer layer than
BMs. In hypoxia, membrane rupture and dispersion promote regulated medication release.

The cytotoxicity of NI-HA-BMs-DOX was detected
Prolonged hypoxia can severely impair cell development. HepG2 cells were treated with the NI-HA-BMs-DOX
complex for 24 h and observed using the MTT test to determine how hypoxia affected cell viability. Figure 5A
shows HepG2 findings. DOX concentration dose-dependently increased cell viability in the DOX and HA-BMs-
DOX treatment groups under hypoxia. The NI-HA-BMs-DOX treatment group had lower cell viability under
hypoxic circumstances at low DOX concentrations than normoxic conditions. At a dosage of 1 µg/mL, cell
viability was lower in hypoxic conditions (73.64%) than in normoxic settings (79.72%). Hypoxic cell viability
exceeded normoxic cell viability at increasing DOX doses. At a dosage of 5 µg/mL, cell viability under hypoxia
was 71.62%, significantly greater than normoxia (57.35%).

HepG2 cells; HA-BMs-DOX: drug group with BMs as a carrier and DOX; NI-HA-BMs-DOX: drug group with
BMs as the carrier and carrying both NI and DOX.
MTT findings for HL-7702 cells are shown in Fig. 5B. Under hypoxic conditions, DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and
NI-HA-BMs-DOX cell viability was consistently higher than normoxic conditions and dose-dependently related
to DOX concentration. These data suggest that the NI-HA-BMs-DOX combination does not reduce HL-7702
cell growth under hypoxia.
The NI-HA-BMs-DOX complex promotes cell apoptosis under hypoxic conditions
For 24 h, HepG2 cells treated with 1 µg/mL DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX under normoxic and
hypoxic conditions showed no significant apoptosis, with normal nuclear morphology and intact structures in
the PBS control group. DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX showed substantial apoptotic bodies under
normoxic and hypoxic environments. DOX and HA-BMs-DOX groups had similar apoptotic body counts under
hypoxia and normoxia. However, the number of apoptotic bodies in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX group increased
dramatically under hypoxia, confirming microscopic observations (Fig. 6) that such complexes promote cell
apoptosis better.
NI-HA-BMs-DOX regulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes in cancer cells
The activation, regulation, and expression of genes during apoptosis contribute to tumor growth and malignancy.
Two well-known apoptotic routes are caspase-mediated intrinsic and extrinsic⁵.
Hypoxic HepG2 cells treated with NI-HA-BMs-DOX for 24 h had considerably higher expression levels of
CASP3²⁸ and CASP8²⁹ both of which are involved in the apoptotic pathway. In contrast, DOX and HA-BMs-
DOX treatment groups had similar CASP3 and CASP8 expression levels in hypoxic and normoxic environments.
Under hypoxia, the CASP9 gene expression in the DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX treatment
groups was slightly reduced compared to normoxic conditions. This upregulation may be due to tumor cells'
enhanced response to endogenous apoptotic signals, which may promote tumor cell apoptosis³⁰.
Moreover, treatment with DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX for 24 h upregulated the expression
of BCL-2³¹ and TP53³² in HepG2 cells. The hypoxia-induced increase in BCL-2 and TP53 expression was greater
in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX group than in normoxic conditions. Conversely, hypoxia increases c-MYC expression³³
was marginally lower in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX group than in normoxia (Fig. 7).
A well-known anti-apoptotic regulator, the BCL-2 gene inhibits programmed cell death. In particular,
pharmacological drugs increased BCL-2 expression in this investigation. This overexpression may explain cancer
cell drug resistance. In particular, cancers often overexpress BCL-2, which accumulates and disrupts the delicate
balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. Dysregulation promotes cell survival and may make
cancer cells more resistant to chemotherapy and targeted treatments³⁴.
Under hypoxia, the DOX-treated group had higher TP53 gene expression than the HA-BMs-DOX group.
TP53 is a tumor suppressor. The absence of hypoxia-responsive molecular components in the HA-BMs-DOX
formulation may hinder DOX release and delivery to target cancer cells. Thus, DOX's incomplete release may
limit its therapeutic effects in the HA-BMs-DOX group.

Fig. 7. HA-BMs-DOX: drug group with BMs as a carrier and DOX; NI-HA-BMs-DOX: BMs carried NI and
DOX, while CK was the control. HepG2 cells were planted in 12-well plates. After cell density reached 80-90%,
cells were treated with 1 µg/mL DOX and the corresponding concentration in BMs for 24 h under normoxic
and hypoxic conditions. The expression levels of associated genes were measured by real-time PCR using
extracted RNA. The relative expression levels were examined using Student's t test, using the reference gene
ß-actin. Results for the control group were plotted using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software, provided as mean ± SD
(n=3).
These data show that NI-HA-BMs-DOX affects apoptosis-related gene expression, with substantial
changes under hypoxic settings, providing a mechanism for increased treatment efficiency in hypoxic tumor
microenvironments.
NI-HA-BMs-DOX significantly inhibit tumor growth
The anticancer efficacy of NI-HA-BMs-DOX was tested in tumor-bearing nude mice by tail vein injection with
DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, or NI-HA-BMs-DOX at 4 mg/kg DOX. Figure 8A shows tumor volume monitoring
during treatment. NI-HA-BMs-DOX showed the most time-dependent tumor growth inhibition, with a final
tumor volume of 412.55 mm³ and a tumor inhibition rate of 55.38%. The HA-BMs-DOX and free DOX groups
had tumor sizes of 512.82 mm³ and 601.83 mm³, respectively, with inhibition rates of 43.88% and 34.90%. The
BMs-alone group showed no substantial tumor suppression, with a tumor volume of 989.58 mm³, identical to
the control group (924.52 mm³), consistent with in vitro findings.
Three-day body weights of naked mice were measured throughout the investigation (Fig. 8B). The negligible
systemic toxicity of NI-HA-BMs-DOX was shown by no significant weight changes. After treatment, tumors
were removed, weighed, and photographed (Fig. 8C and D). The average tumor weight in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX
group was 0.40 g, significantly lower than the HA-BMs-DOX (0.69 g) and free DOX (0.67 g) groups. Instead, the
BMs-alone group had an average tumor weight of 1.04 g, which was similar to the control group.

via tail vein every 3 days. Every three days, naked mice body weights and tumor volumes were measured

In addition to tumors, the heart, liver and lung tissues of mice were collected for H&E staining. The control
and BMs groups showed similar pathological features, with tissue sections displaying a mixture of densely and
lightly stained regions. The darkly stained areas contained clusters of small, immature cells exhibiting strong
basophilia, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and hyperchromatic nuclei with round, oval or polygonal shapes.
In contrast, the lightly stained regions comprised larger cells with pale nuclei containing prominent nucleoli,
irregular nuclear morphology, poorly defined cellular boundaries, and frequent mitotic figures-all characteristic
of highly proliferative tumor tissue. Treatment with DOX and HA-BMs-DOX resulted in measurable reductions
in tumor malignancy, as evidenced by decreased cellular atypia. However, the most significant therapeutic
effect was observed in the NI-HA-BMs-DOX group, which demonstrated marked reductions in immature cell
populations and hyperchromatic nuclear regions. Control cardiomyocytes exhibited normal spindle-shaped
morphology with pale blue cytoplasm and aligned nuclei, while myocardial fibers maintained regular parallel

arrangement without pathological changes. Importantly, all treatment groups (BMs, DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and
NI-HA-BMs-DOX) showed identical myocardial architecture to controls. The control group exhibited compact
liver structure with spherical to oval hepatocytes displaying eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent nuclei, and
clearly visible nucleoli. Comparative analysis demonstrated that all treatment groups-including BMs, DOX, HA-
BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX - maintained normal hepatic histology indistinguishable from controls. The
control group showed normal alveolar structure with thin septa and patent air spaces, while all treatment groups
(BMs, DOX, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX) maintained comparable lung histology with only minor
variations (Fig. 9). In summary, these findings demonstrate that bacterial magnetosomes (BMs) represent an
excellent drug delivery platform. When combined with 2-nitroimidazole to exploit tumor hypoxia, the resulting
NI-HA-BMs-DOX formulation exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy while maintaining an excellent safety
profile in major organs.
Drug-Loaded BMs penetrate tumor tissue and exhibit antitumor effects
To evaluate the biodistribution of bacterial magnetosomes (BMs) and their tumor-targeting potential, iron
content in various organs and tissues was quantified using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry
(Fig. 10). The results revealed significantly higher iron accumulation in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of the
treatment groups compared to the control group, consistent with the roles of these organs in metabolic processing
and clearance.
Notably, elevated iron levels were also detected in tumor tissues of the BMs, HA-BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-
DOX treatment groups. This finding confirms the successful penetration of BMs into tumor tissues, suggesting
their effective localization within the tumor microenvironment. The accumulation of drug-loaded BMs at the
tumor site supports their potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy by leveraging the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect. These results highlight the promise of BMs-based drug delivery systems for targeted
cancer therapy.
Discussion
This study generated hypoxia-sensing drug delivery nanocomposites (NI-HA-BMs-DOX) from nitrogen-doped
iron (NI), hyaluronic acid (HA), bioactive magnetosomes (BMs), and doxorubicin. Flow cytometry showed that
the NI-HA-BMs-DOX complex released more DOX into tumor cells and inhibited tumor cell growth more than
the HA-BMs-DOX complex under hypoxia. These drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) interact with DNA via DOX
to modulate apoptosis-related gene expression and promote tumor cell death.
Hypoxia caused more apoptotic cells than normoxia due to the NI-HA-BMs-DOX complex. Moreover, the
NI-HA-BMs-DOX combination caused a much greater apoptotic effect than HA-BMs-DOX or free DOX. The
NI-HA-BMs-DOX complex enhanced tumor inhibition by upregulating apoptosis-related genes like CASP3,
CASP8, and CASP9 and modulating the proto-oncogenes c-MYC, BCL-2, and TP53.
In tumor-bearing nude mice, intravenous NI-HA-BMs-DOX (4 mg/kg DOX) caused tumor-targeted delivery
through the increased permeability and retention (EPR) effect and hypoxic microenvironment targeting. Rapid
proliferation and hypoxia in tumor cells create a microenvironment that helps transport NP complexes to
tumors. The NI-HA-BMs-DOX group inhibited tumors 55.38%, significantly greater than the HA-BMs-DOX

Fig. 10. HA-BMs-DOX represents the treatment group in which bacterial magnetosomes (BMs) were used as
a carrier for doxorubicin (DOX). NI-HA-BMs-DOX refers to BMs loaded with both 2-nitroimidazole (NI) and
DOX. The control group (CK) received no treatment. Tumor tissues were digested in nitric acid and heated
at 100 °C for 3 h. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to quantify
iron ion content in the samples. Data were analyzed and visualized using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software and are

(43.88%) and free DOX (34.90%) groups. Notably, the NI-HA-BMs-DOX treatment increased tumor tissue BM
accumulation, enabling more effective drug release and tumor suppression.
Due to iron metabolism, the liver, spleen, and kidneys of treated mice accumulated more iron. The BMs, HA-
BMs-DOX, and NI-HA-BMs-DOX groups had higher iron concentration in their tumor tissues, showing that
BMs penetrated tumor tissue and had anticancer effects.
Tumor microenvironment hypoxia is well-known and plays a key role in tumor development, metastasis, and
treatment resistance³⁵. Tumor hypoxia causes poor vascularization, genetic instability, and invasiveness, which
increases therapeutic resistance⁴. Reduced drug penetration, intrinsic chemoresistance mechanisms (including
lack of p53-mediated apoptosis), and defective DNA repair make hypoxic cells more resistant to chemotherapy³⁶.
These issues require drug delivery systems that can overcome tumor hypoxia to boost treatment efficacy.
As tumor medication transporters, magnetic nanoparticles like BMs are advantageous. They are ideal for
targeted therapy because to their nanoscale size and ability to be focused and concentrated under a magnetic
field³⁷. Furthermore, the lipid membrane coating of BMs provides biocompatibility, which is essential for their
use in therapeutic applications³⁸ This study did not completely harness BMs' magnetic targeting capability,
but future research can maximize these properties to improve drug-loaded BM targeting precision and tumor
inhibition. This could improve tumor suppression and systemic toxicity, which are crucial for drug delivery
system therapeutic value.
Conclusion
We tested a hypoxia-sensitive drug delivery nanocomposite (Ni-HA-BMs-DOX) made of nitrogen-doped iron
(NI), hyaluronic acid (HA), doxorubicin (DOX), and bioactive magnetosomes (BMs) for anticancer activity.
Tumor's hypoxic microenvironment allows targeted medication release at tumor cell accumulation, inhibiting
tumor growth. In vitro studies showed that NI-HA-BMs-DOX boosted tumor cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis
by influencing tumor growth and apoptosis genes. NI-HA-BMs-DOX also inhibited tumor growth in tumor-
bearing nude mice, outperforming HA-BMs-DOX and free DOX. This work introduces a unique drug delivery
technology and a promising cancer-targeted therapy technique that may improve cancer treatment efficacy.
