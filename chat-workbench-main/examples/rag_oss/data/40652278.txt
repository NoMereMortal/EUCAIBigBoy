ATM, RAD51, and BAX genes in gastric cancer
and their contribution to radiotherapy
resistance
Junwei Zhang and Pengtao He²*
Abstract
Background Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
genetic factors contributing to gastric cancer progression and resistance to therapies, particularly radiotherapy, are
not fully understood. TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX are genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and response to stress.
The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of these genes in gastric cancer, their potential role in
radiotherapy resistance, and their diagnostic value.
Methodology Gene expression levels of TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX were assessed using RT-qPCR across 9 gastric
cancer cell lines and 6 normal control cell lines. Additionally, protein expression was confirmed via IHC and TCGA
dataset analysis. Methylation levels of these genes were evaluated in gastric cancer tissues using the GSCA database.
Mutational analysis was conducted using cBioPortal, and survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and
meta-analysis. The radiotherapy resistance study was carried out by knocking down TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and
MKN-45 gastric cancer cell lines, followed by expression analysis, colony formation, and wound healing assays.
Results The expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX was significantly upregulated, while ATM was downregulated
in gastric cancer cell lines compared to normal controls. All four genes demonstrated good discriminatory
power (AUC = 1) in distinguishing gastric cancer from normal samples. Methylation analysis revealed significant
hypomethylation of TP53, RAD51, and BAX, and hypermethylation of ATM in gastric cancer tissues. Mutational analysis
showed that TP53 was altered in 88% of gastric cancer samples, while ATM, RAD51, and BAX exhibited lower mutation
rates. Survival analysis suggested that elevated expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX may be linked to poorer survival
outcomes, while reduced ATM expression appeared to associate with decreased overall survival. However, these
associations require further validation through additional studies. Knockdown of TP53, RAD51, and BAX in AGS and
MKN-45 cells resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation and slower wound healing, highlighting their role in
radiotherapy resistance.

distinguishing gastric cell lines from normal controls, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.0 for each gene. (C) Expression profiles of TP53, ATM, RAD51,
and BAX were further validated using patient tumor and normal tissue data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via the GSCA online platform. (D)
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining images and data obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database corroborated the mRNA findings, showing
higher protein expression of TP53, RAD51, and BAX, and reduced protein levels of ATM in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa. (E)
Analysis of gene expression across different pathological stages of gastric cancer using the GEPIA2 platform revealed no statistically significant stage-

Fig. 3 Mutational and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX in gastric cancer. (A) Overall mutation frequency analysis
revealed that TP53 was the most frequently altered gene, mutated in 88% of gastric samples, followed by ATM (17%) and RAD51 (1%). BAX showed no
detectable mutations in the analyzed cohort. (B) Mutation type distribution shows that TP53 mutations were predominantly missense mutations (green
bars), along with frameshift deletions (orange bars) and splice site mutations (blue bars). ATM alterations also included a mix of missense and frameshift
deletions. RAD51 alterations were limited and primarily missense in nature. (C) Copy number variation (CNV) analysis illustrated the diversity in genomic
alterations. TP53 exhibited a high proportion of amplifications (red) and deletions (green). ATM displayed a similar CNV pattern. RAD51 showed minimal
CNV changes, with most samples displaying no significant alterations (gray). BAX exhibited a balanced CNV profile, with a mix of amplifications, deletions,

Fig. 6 Identification and validation of hsa-miR-15b-5p as a key miRNA targeting TP53, ATM, RAD51, and BAX in gastric cancer. (A) miRNA-mRNA interac-

BAX, indicating its central role in gene regulation. (B) Expression analysis using the UALCAN database showed significantly elevated levels of hsa-miR-
15b-5p in primary gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric tissues (p 0.01). (C) RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of hsa-miR-15b-5p
