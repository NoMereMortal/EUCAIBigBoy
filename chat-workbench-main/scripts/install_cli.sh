# Chat Workbench CLI Installation Script
# ========================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Builds the Rust-based CWB (Chat Workbench) CLI and installs it on the
#   local system for the current user.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/install_cli.sh
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#   The script first attempts to install the CLI using `cargo install`.
#   If cargo is available, this is the preferred method. If cargo is not
#   found, it falls back to copying the compiled binary to /usr/local/bin,
#   which may require sudo privileges.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - Rust and Cargo must be installed for the primary installation method.
#     Installation instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
#
# ========================================================================
